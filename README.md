# JVM class dependencies browser demo

This repository demonstrates a browser of JVM class dependencies,
using the Scala 2.13.0 library JAR as its data source.
Go to [its GitHub Pages site](https://performantdata.github.io/jvm-class-dependencies-demo/) to see it in action.

## navigation
- Scrolling zooms the view in and out.
- Dragging drags the graph.
- Hovering over a node in the graph displays its class name in a tooltip (if you're using a desktop browser).
- Selecting/deselecting checkboxes in the control pane shows/hides the corresponding type of node or edge.
